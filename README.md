Welcome to our project to explore the origin of human!

We propose a novel method named Divided Natural Vector baesd on the published Natural Vector method. The latter has been successfully applied on many datasets.

Due to the limitation of storage on Github, we add a toy data in `./data/` folder. You can find the recovered sequences for 2504 individiduals named as `xxIDxx.fa`, and with two vectors: the traditional natural vector and divided natural vector (k=4) in separate folders, both named as `out_xxIDxx.fa`. The computation is done in Perl with higher time efficiency compared to MATLAB.

The raw data of phylogenetic tree is stored in `./tree_files`, such as the nwk files and the figures.
